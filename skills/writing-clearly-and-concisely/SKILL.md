# Writing Clearly and Concisely

## Overview

William Strunk Jr.'s *The Elements of Style* (1918) - foundational rules for clear, vigorous writing.

**WARNING:** `elements-of-style.md` is ~12,000 tokens. Only read when actively writing/editing prose.

## When to Use

- Writing documentation, README files, technical explanations
- Drafting user-facing text (error messages, UI copy, help text)
- Editing for clarity and conciseness
- Grammar, punctuation, or usage questions

## Limited Context Strategy

If low on tokens:
1. Write normally using best judgment
2. Dispatch subagent with your draft and `elements-of-style.md`
3. Ask subagent to copyedit and return revised version

## All Rules

### Elementary Rules of Usage (Grammar/Punctuation)
1. Form possessive singular by adding 's
2. Use comma after each term in series except last
3. Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas
4. Comma before conjunction introducing co-ordinate clause
5. Don't join independent clauses by comma
6. Don't break sentences in two
7. Participial phrase at beginning refers to grammatical subject

### Elementary Principles of Composition
8. One paragraph per topic
9. Begin paragraph with topic sentence
10. **Use active voice**
11. **Put statements in positive form**
12. **Use definite, specific, concrete language**
13. **Omit needless words**
14. Avoid succession of loose sentences
