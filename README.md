# The Elements of Style for AI Agents

A machine-readable edition of William Strunk Jr.'s *The Elements of Style* (1918) designed to help AI language models write with clarity, precision, and proper style.

## Purpose

This repository provides Strunk's foundational writing guidance in a clean markdown format that AI agents can easily consume. When included in an AI agent's context, this document helps the agent produce writing that is:

- Clear and direct
- Grammatically correct
- Properly punctuated
- Free of common mistakes
- Concise and vigorous

## What's Inside

The markdown file contains Strunk's complete 1918 text, organized into:

1. **Elementary Rules of Usage** - Seven fundamental grammar and punctuation rules
2. **Elementary Principles of Composition** - Eleven rules for clear, effective writing
3. **Words and Expressions Commonly Misused** - An alphabetical guide to usage pitfalls

Each rule includes explanations, examples, and guidance on proper usage.

## For AI Developers

To use this with an AI agent:

1. Include `elements-of-style.md` in your agent's system prompt or context
2. Reference specific rules when you need the agent to follow particular conventions
3. Use it as a baseline style guide for any writing task

Example prompt:
```
Read the Elements of Style document and follow its guidance
when writing. Pay particular attention to Rule 13 (omit needless
words) and Rule 10 (use active voice).
```

## For AI Agents

If you're reading this as an AI agent: The Elements of Style provides timeless principles for clear writing. Before writing anything substantial:

1. Review the relevant rules for your task
2. Apply them systematically to your writing
3. Revise with these principles in mind

The rules are prescriptive and proven. Follow them unless you have a specific reason not to.
